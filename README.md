# CapstoneExtension_MultiClass_SemanticSegmentation
ABOUT MY CAPSTONE :
Structures in the abdominal region have complex non-geometric overlapping boundaries making it difficult to distinguish and segment them accurately. Low contrast and being surrounded by multiple layers of tissue and organs add to the segmentation difficulty. In this region, we focused on specific abdominal wall muscles which include the left flank, left rectus, right flank, and right rectus.
The abdominal muscles play a crucial role in medical imaging as they provide valuable information for diagnosing abnormalities such as hernias, tumors, and neuro-muscular diseases. Accurate segmentation of these muscles can provide important quantitative information about their size, shape, and location, which can help clinicians make more informed decisions and improve patient outcomes.
The capstone focuses on the automated segmentation of specific abdominal wall muscles. This region of interest was chosen due to the low quantity of research done, difficulty in manual annotation, and application in hernia detection and diagnosis of abdomen wall diseases. The lack of quality publicly available datasets sparked the need to create a novel dataset. This novel dataset was created through careful manual annotations of abdominal CTs and has gone through several ground-truth cheques with professionals.
